# Digit-Recognition-Using-NN
This project focuses on building a neural network model for classifying handwritten digits (0-9). The main aim of this project is to build a precise and efficient system for automatically identifying and classifying the digits.<br/> The dataset used in this project is the MNIST dataset. The dataset is available in the Keras library in Python. Achieved an overall accuracy of 90%.

## Features
- Downloading and importing the dataset
- Building an efficient neural network model
- Testing the accuracy of this model
